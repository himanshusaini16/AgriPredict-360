## 🧠 Tech Stack

### ⚛️ React.js (Frontend)
- React.js is used to build a fast, responsive, and component-based user interface.
- It enables smooth navigation, reusable UI components, and efficient state management.
- The frontend is deployed on **Vercel** for high availability and fast global delivery.
- Integrated with backend APIs using Axios/Fetch.



### ☕ Java Spring Boot (Backend)
- Spring Boot powers the backend REST APIs with a clean and scalable architecture.
- Handles authentication, prediction requests, user history, and data persistence.
- Easily integrates with MongoDB Atlas and ONNX models.
- Deployed on **Render** using Docker for consistent runtime behavior.

---

### 🔐 Google Cloud Console (Google Login)
- Google OAuth 2.0 is implemented using Google Cloud Console.
- Provides secure and seamless login using Google accounts.
- Eliminates the need for manual password management.
- Improves user experience and application security.

---

### 🐳 Docker
- Docker is used to containerize the Spring Boot backend.
- Ensures consistent environments across development and production.
- Simplifies deployment on cloud platforms like Render.
- Makes scaling and maintenance easier.

---

### ☁️ Cloudinary
- Cloudinary is used for image storage and management.
- User profile images and disease images are securely uploaded and stored.
- Provides fast image delivery and optimization.
- Reduces backend storage overhead.

---

### 🍃 MongoDB Atlas
- MongoDB Atlas is used as a cloud-hosted NoSQL database.
- Stores user data, prediction results, and history efficiently.
- Highly scalable and secure with automatic backups.
- Easily integrates with Spring Boot.

---

### 🧪 Python & Machine Learning
- Python is used to train machine learning models.
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) are used for image-based disease prediction.
- Additional models are trained using CSV-based datasets for crop prediction.
- Ensures accurate and data-driven predictions.

---

### 🔁 ONNX (Model Integration)
- Trained ML models are converted to **ONNX** format.
- ONNX allows seamless usage of ML models inside Java Spring Boot.
- Improves performance and interoperability.
- Eliminates the need for a separate Python inference server.

---

### 📮 Postman
- Postman is used to test and validate backend APIs.
- Helps in debugging request/response flows.
- Ensures API reliability before frontend integration.
- Useful for testing authentication and prediction endpoints.
